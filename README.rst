Small World Network Graph Viewer
================================

A small webapp for viewing the network graph of ``Small World`` bridges between cards in a deck. It's a rewrite of an earlier Python script I used for generating previous MasterDuelMeta submissions (`e.g. <https://x-x-i-l.github.io/webhosting/fourattrib_windwitch_smallworld/>`_), now with the ability to add additional cards to the graph in-browser, and reflect the changes in the URL for potential sharing.

`Direct link <https://x-x-i-l.github.io/smallworld/>`_ to the webapp hosted on GitHub Pages
