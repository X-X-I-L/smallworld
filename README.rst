Small World Network Graph Viewer
================================

A small webapp for viewing the network graph of ``Small World`` bridges between cards in a deck. It's a rewrite of an earlier Python script I used for generating previous MasterDuelMeta submissions (`e.g. <https://x-x-i-l.github.io/webhosting/fourattrib_windwitch_smallworld/>`_), now with the ability to add additional cards to the graph in-browser, and reflect the changes in the URL for potential sharing.

How do I *remove* cards from the graph?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

idk lol. Just edit them out of the URL manually, the IDs listed are the same as the passwords listed in the bottom left of a given card. Or navigate back through your browser history. Or implement something and shoot me a PR. Or message me that this is something actually wanted, as I personally have no need for this feature.
